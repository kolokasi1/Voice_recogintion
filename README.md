# Spotify Voice Recognition Project

This project enables voice-controlled interactions with Spotify, allowing users to add songs to their playlists using spoken commands. Built with Flask and integrating the Spotify Web API, it offers a seamless experience for managing playlists through voice.

## Features

- **Voice Commands**: Use your voice to control Spotify playback and manage playlists.
- **Playlist Management**: Add the currently playing song to a designated playlist through voice.
- **Continuous Listening**: The app continuously listens for commands, making it easy to use while away from your keyboard.
- **Secure Authentication**: Implements OAuth2 for secure authentication with Spotify.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Flask
- SpeechRecognition
- requests_oauthlib

You can install the necessary libraries with pip:

```bash
pip install Flask SpeechRecognition requests_oauthlib

Installing
A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running:
Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-voice-recognition.git
cd spotify-voice-recognition
Set up your Spotify Developer Account
Go to Spotify Developer Dashboard and create an app.
Note down the Client ID and Client Secret.
Set the Redirect URI to http://localhost:3000/callback.
Place your Client ID and Client Secret into the .env file in your project directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist and add the following:
arduino
Copy code
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='your_spotify_client_id_here'
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='your_spotify_client_secret_here'
Run the application
bash
Copy code
python spotify_playlist.py
Navigate the application
Login Page: Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000. Start by logging in using your Spotify credentials.
Listening Page: After logging in, you will be directed to start interacting with your voice. Simply speak the playlist names to add the currently playing song.


Certainly! I'll enhance the README.md content to include instructions on where users can navigate within the app to use specific features, and detailed steps on how to set up Spotify Client ID and Client Secret. I'll then provide this as a file you can download.

Hereâ€™s the updated content for the README.md:
